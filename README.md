### Built with

### What I learned

A fairly straight forward challenge: 3 column layout using flexbox. I was able to use Sass (including nesting!) I look forward to improving my Sass skills

### Useful resources

- [Sass Tutorial for Beginners - CSS With Superpowers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a5j7KoflTs) - This helped me with my file structure and nesting. I really liked this pattern and will use it (somewhat modified) moving forward.
- [Sass and BEM for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfMHA8SqUL4&t=2659s) - This is an amazing article which helped me get started and use @forward with partials. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
